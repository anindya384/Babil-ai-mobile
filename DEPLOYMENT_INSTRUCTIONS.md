# 🚀 Daily Question Tracking Fix - Deployment Instructions

## ✅ **Problem Solved**
The daily question count was resetting when users logged out and logged back in, allowing them to bypass the 20-question daily limit.

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**
- **Database-based tracking**: Daily question count now stored in Supabase database
- **Persistent across sessions**: Count persists even after logout/login
- **Automatic daily reset**: Count resets at midnight automatically
- **Secure**: Cannot be manipulated by clearing localStorage

## 📋 **Deployment Steps**

### 1. **Apply Database Migration**
```bash
# Navigate to your Supabase project
cd supabase

# Apply the new migration
supabase db push
```

### 2. **Deploy Edge Function**
```bash
# Deploy the daily-questions function
supabase functions deploy daily-questions
```

### 3. **Deploy Frontend Changes**
```bash
# Commit and push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Implement database-based daily question tracking to prevent limit bypass"
git push origin main

# Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify/etc.)
```

## 🗄️ **Database Changes**

### New Fields Added to `profiles` table:
- `daily_questions_used` (INTEGER): Count of questions used today
- `last_question_date` (DATE): Date of last question (auto-resets daily)

### New Edge Function:
- `daily-questions`: Handles getting/incrementing daily question counts

## 🔒 **Security Features**

1. **Persistent Tracking**: Question count stored in database, not localStorage
2. **Daily Reset**: Automatically resets at midnight
3. **User Isolation**: Each user has their own daily count
4. **JWT Verification**: Edge function verifies user authentication

## 🧪 **Testing**

1. **Use 20 questions** in one session
2. **Log out and log back in** - count should remain at 0
3. **Wait until midnight** - count should reset to 20
4. **Try to ask a question** after limit - should show "Daily Limit Reached"

## 📱 **User Experience**

- Users see accurate remaining question count
- Count persists across browser sessions
- Clear indication when daily limit is reached
- No more bypassing limits through logout/login

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

- **Clear History button** still only clears chat display, not question count
- **Daily limit** is enforced at the database level
- **Fallback handling** included for edge cases
- **Backward compatible** with existing users

## 🔍 **Monitoring**

Check Supabase logs for:
- Daily question tracking function calls
- Database updates to question counts
- Any errors in the tracking system

## ✅ **Verification**

After deployment, verify:
1. Question count persists after logout/login
2. Daily limit is properly enforced
3. Count resets at midnight
4. No errors in browser console
5. Edge function responds correctly

**This fix ensures users cannot bypass the daily question limit by logging out and back in!** 🎯
